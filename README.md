## Key Features
- Admin can register candidates
- Each address can vote only once
- Votes are publicly recorded on-chain
- Real-time vote tally
- Easy candidate result retrieval

## Future Scope
- Implement time-based voting deadlines
- Introduce voter registration with KYC
- Use Chainlink VRF for randomness in tie-breaking
- Frontend DApp integration for real-time interactions
- Voting anonymization using zero-knowledge proofs
